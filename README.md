# RestDoc Specification

Welcome to the RestDoc project! This project created a language-agnostic 
specification for self-describing REST API's that can be used to create powerful,
re-usable tooling and client libraries.

Version 1.0 was just released on December 2nd, 2012 and can be found on <http://www.restdoc.org>.

Discussion and brainstorming for specification updates is happening on 
the [wiki](https://github.com/RestDoc/specification/wiki) and
[issues](https://github.com/RestDoc/specification/issues) of this project.

Another place is the Google group RestDoc <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/restdoc>.

Please jump in and contribute your ideas and insights!
