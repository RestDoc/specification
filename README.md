# RestDoc Specification

Welcome to the RestDoc project! This project hopes to create a language-agnostic
specification for self-describing REST API's that can be used to create
powerful, re-usable tooling and client libraries.

For the moment, discussion and brainstorming for the specification is happening
on the [wiki](https://github.com/RestDoc/wiki) and
[issues](https://github.com/RestDoc/issues) of this project. Please jump
in and contribute your ideas and insights!
